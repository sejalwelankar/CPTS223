# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main| PA1 ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Build Code
        
      # Choose the working directory
      working-directory: ${{github.workspace}}  # YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE FOLDER NAME TO YOUR OWN FOLDER NAME
      shell: bash
      # This step will execute the build. 1. Create a build directory. 2. Config cmake. 3. Build the project using cmake
      run: (mkdir build;cmake -B build -S .;cmake --build build) # NO NEED TO CHANGE HERE
